# 📸 ZłappChwilę (means Catch the Moment) — The Budget Wedding Photobooth

Welcome to **ZłappChwilę** — a lovingly handcrafted, slightly chaotic, but very effective **DIY wedding photobooth app** 💍✨

No fancy hardware.  
No rented photobooth for thousands.  
Just an iPhone (17), a printer (Canon Selphy CP1500) and guests having fun.

## 💡 What is this app?

This app was created for our wedding as a **“budget photobooth”** alternative.

The idea is simple:

- Guests take a photo 📸
- The photo gets a wedding frame 🖼️
- It prints instantly 🖨️
- One can is for the guest  
- The other one can go into the **guest book**, with a sweet message 💌

That’s it.  
Simple, fun and full of memories.

## 🎉 What guests can do

1. Tap **“Take a photo”**
2. Smile, pose, be weird 😄
3. See the photo with a wedding frame
4. Print it (choose the number of copies)
5. 📖 Paste one copy into the guest book  
6. ✍️ Write something nice for the newlyweds

Repeat as many times as you want.
